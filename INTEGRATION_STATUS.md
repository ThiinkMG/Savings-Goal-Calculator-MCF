## GOOGLE SHEETS NEXT STEPS

To complete the Google Sheets integration:
1. Verify the GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY format in secrets
2. Ensure the service account has Sheets API permissions
3. The code is ready - just needs credential fix

The integration will then provide:
- Live spreadsheet updates
- Real-time data synchronization  
- Comprehensive analytics in Google Sheets format
