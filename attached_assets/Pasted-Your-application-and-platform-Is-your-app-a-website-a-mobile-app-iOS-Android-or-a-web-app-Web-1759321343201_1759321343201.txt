Your application and platform
Is your app a website, a mobile app (iOS/Android), or a web app?
Website: Is it a single-page application (SPA), a server-rendered app, or a simple static site?
Mobile App: Are you using native SDKs (Swift/Kotlin) or a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter?
What technology stack is your app built on?
Frontend: (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, plain JavaScript)
Backend: (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, .NET)
Does your app currently have its own user database?
If yes, is there a plan to migrate those users to Wix members, or will you need to handle logins from both systems?
Are you using a frontend framework that is compatible with the Wix SDK?
Wix provides a JavaScript SDK that simplifies implementation, but you will need to determine if it's the right fit for your project. 
User experience and interface
What is the desired look and feel of the login screen?
Wix-managed (easiest): Do you prefer to redirect users to a standard Wix-branded login page? This is the fastest way to get started and is a low-effort approach.
Custom (more complex): Do you need a seamless, branded login experience that looks and feels like a native part of your app?
Will users have separate accounts on your app and Wix, or do you want to unify them?
This is critical for determining whether you need to handle account matching or consolidation.
What post-login experience do you want?
For example, will authenticated users be immediately redirected to a specific part of your app, or will they be returned to the page they were on? 
Security and backend logic
How are you currently handling user sessions and state?
(e.g., JWTs, server-side sessions, cookies)
Are you familiar with the OAuth 2.0 with PKCE authorization flow?
Implementing a custom login page requires understanding this protocol to handle token exchanges securely.
Do you need to perform server-side actions on behalf of the member?
This includes tasks like creating or deleting member data. These actions require a specific Admin API Key authentication strategy in addition to the member's OAuth tokens.
How will you handle sensitive data and tokens?
Wix's SDK and API documentation describe the process for securely storing tokens, but your implementation will depend on your backend's architecture
