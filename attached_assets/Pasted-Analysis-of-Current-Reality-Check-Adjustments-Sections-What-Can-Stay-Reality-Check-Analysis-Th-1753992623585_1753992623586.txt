Analysis of Current Reality Check & Adjustments Sections
What Can Stay:

Reality Check Analysis - The feasibility score, success probability, and stress test are valuable
Daily Reality Breakdown - The per day/week/hour breakdown with the critical thinking question is good
Overall structure - The dropdown format works well

What Needs Major Updates:
1. "What You're Actually Giving Up" Section - BROKEN

345 coffee shop visits per month = 11+ per day (impossible)
76 pizza deliveries per month = 2.5+ per day (absurd)
127 movie tickets per month = 4+ per day (ridiculous)
24 monthly subscription services = unrealistic comparison

2. "Precision Adjustments" Section - NOT HELPFUL

"0.2 months earlier" = meaningless to users (6 days?)
"0.3 months earlier" = still too abstract
Fractional months don't help with decision-making
"Add $158 to remaining months" = unclear action

Core Issues Identified:

Math is completely wrong in opportunity cost calculations
Fractional months are confusing instead of real dates
No actionable insights - users don't know what to do with this info
Unrealistic comparisons that lose credibility


Proposed Updates Report
PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
Current State Issues:

Users see impossible numbers (345 coffees/month) and lose trust
Fractional months (0.2 months earlier) are meaningless in daily life
No clear connection between adjustments and real lifestyle changes
Information doesn't lead to actionable decisions

User Impact:

Confusion about what the numbers mean
Loss of credibility due to obvious errors
No clear next steps after viewing the analysis
Difficulty understanding the real trade-offs

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Fix "What You're Actually Giving Up" - Make it Realistic
Replace impossible calculations with realistic weekly/monthly trade-offs:

"Skip lunch out 3 times per week" instead of "76 pizzas per month"
"Make coffee at home on weekdays" instead of "345 coffee visits"
"Choose 2 streaming services instead of 5" instead of "24 subscriptions"

2. Replace "Precision Adjustments" with "Real Timeline Impact"
Replace fractional months with actual dates and meaningful timeframes:

"Save $25 more = reach goal by March 15 instead of March 28"
"Save $50 more = reach goal by February 20 instead of March 28"
Show actual calendar impact rather than abstract month fractions

3. Add "Decision Helper" Section
New section that guides action:

"To save $25 more: Choose 2 of these â†’ [Skip 1 lunch out weekly] [Make coffee at home 3x/week] [Cancel 1 subscription]"
Give users concrete choices rather than abstract math

4. Add "Reality vs. Capacity" Check
Compare required savings to their stated monthly capacity:

"You need $400/month but set capacity at $300/month - your plan needs adjustment"
Show the gap between what they want and what they've committed to

Updated Sections Would Include:

Realistic Trade-offs (fix broken math)
Actual Dates (replace fractional months)
Actionable Choices (concrete next steps)
Capacity vs. Need Analysis (reality check)
