Verify Requests Received from Wix
When you receive a data payload from Wix, it includes a header called digest. The header holds a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the signed data.

Before using the data you've received, you should:

Verify the JWT's signature to confirm that the data was sent by Wix.
Verify the integrity of the data (for encrypted payloads only â€“ not webhooks).
Here's a sample JWT:

Step 1 | Verify that the data came from Wix
To verify that the data came from Wix:

Select your app from the Custom Apps page in your Wix Studio Workspace.
At the top of your app's home page, click More Actions  and select View ID & keys.
Copy the public key and use it to decode the JWT.
Here's what the data looks like once its been decoded and verified with your public key:



Note: View a sample decoded JWT in the JWT debugger.

Step 2 | Verify the integrity of the data
In some cases, the payload data will be encrypted as a security precaution. If the data is encrypted, it's crucial to ensure its integrity and confirm that it hasn't been altered during transit.

Note: Webhook payloads are not encrypted.

The encrypted payload data includes an object with a hash of the payload data, and the hash type as its key. For example: 

Copy
"data": 
{
    "SHA256": "3fd05dfe429837da86cbc710190c9a67296203bbd4bd3160ab0ff07b659b0160"
}
To verify the integrity of the data:

Take the encrypted body data you received and hash it using the same hashing algorithm listed in the data object. In our example: 

Hash type: SHA256
Body data: {"mydata":"is secured"}
Compare the new hash with the hash listed in the data object. For example: Sha256({"mydata":"is secured"}) yields 3fd05dfe429837da86cbc710190c9a67296203bbd4bd3160ab0ff07b659b0160.
