i dont have an app just the wix studio site

Understood. If you don't have a separate app and are working directly with a Wix Studio site, you can still integrate OAuth to authenticate users and access their member data. Here’s how you can proceed:

1. Set Up OAuth in Wix Studio:
   - Ensure your Wix Studio site is configured to support OAuth. This typically involves setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) if you are using Wix's enterprise solutions.

2. Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret:
   - If you have the Client ID, you should also have the Client Secret. These are usually provided when you set up OAuth in the Wix Developer Center or through your Wix Studio enterprise account.

3. OAuth Flow:
   - Follow the OAuth flow to authenticate users and access their member data. Here’s a simplified version of the steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Authorization Request:
   - Redirect users to the Wix authorization endpoint with your Client ID and requested scopes.
   - Example URL:
     ```html
     https://www.wix.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=members.read%20email
     ```

2. Authorization Code:
   - After the user authorizes your app, Wix will redirect them back to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code.

3. Token Exchange:
   - Use the authorization code to request an access token from Wix.
   - Make a POST request to the token endpoint:
     ```html
     https://www.wix.com/oauth/access
     ```
   - Include your Client ID, Client Secret, authorization code, and redirect URI in the request body.

### Example Implementation in Replit:

Here’s a basic example using Python and Flask to handle the OAuth flow:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
REDIRECT_URI = 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Login with Wix'

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    auth_url = f"https://www.wix.com/oauth/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&response_type=code&scope=members.read%20email"
    return redirect(auth_url)

@app.route('/callback')
def callback():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    token_url = 'https://www.wix.com/oauth/access'
    data = {
        'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
        'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
        'code': code,
        'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI,
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code'
    }
    response = requests.post(token_url, data=data)
    token_info = response.json()
    access_token = token_info['access_token']
    
    # Use the access token to access member data
    member_info_url = 'https://www.wix.com/_api/members/v1/members/me'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
    member_response = requests.get(member_info_url, headers=headers)
    member_info = member_response.json()
    
    return f"Hello, {member_info['name']}!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Important Notes:
- Client Secret: Ensure you have the Client Secret from your Wix Studio setup.
- Scopes: Make sure you request the necessary scopes (`members.read`, `email`) to access member data.
- Redirect URI: Ensure the redirect URI is correctly set up in your Wix Studio settings and matches the one used in your OAuth requests.
